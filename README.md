# Efficient Supply Allocation in Ride-Hailing

The success of a ride-hailing platform relies heavily on the efficient matching of supply and demand in real time. In this notebook, we address the challenge of efficient supply allocation, aiming to ensure that riders can always find a ride while drivers maintain stable earnings. Specifically, we explore the dynamics of ride demand over time and space to guide drivers toward areas with higher expected demand.

## Introduction


### Problem Statement

The primary goal is to develop a solution that leverages data science techniques to allocate drivers effectively based on historical ride demand patterns. We will utilize a synthetic ride demand dataset, resembling real-life scenarios in the city of Tallinn, Estonia.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following key columns:
> - `start_time`: Time when the ride order was made.
> - `start_lat`: Latitude of the order's pick-up point.
> - `start_lng`: Longitude of the order's pick-up point.
> - `end_lat`: Latitude of the order's destination point.
> - `end_lng`: Longitude of the order's destination point.
> - `ride_value`: How much monetary value is in this particular ride.

### Task Overview

For this task, we are expected to:

> 1. Explore the data and suggest a solution to guide the drivers towards areas with higher expected demand at given time and location
> 2. Build and document a baseline model for your solution
> 3. Describe how you would design and deploy such a model
> 4. Describe how to communicate model recommendations to drivers
> 5. Think through and describe the design of the experiment  that would validate your solution for live operations taking into account marketplace specifics

Let's begin by importing the project's dependencies, loading, and exploring the dataset to gain insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of ride demand.
